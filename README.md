# SkyrimNet - coldsun1187 Papyrus Fork

Public facing repository housing prompts, scripts, and game files for SkyrimNet

Some files like `SkyrimNetApi.psc`, `skynet_ExampleScript.psc`, `SkyrimNet_agDebugLever01.psc`, `skynet_MainController.psc`, and `skynet_PlayerAlias.psc` are already well-structured and don't need major changes.

## Summary of Improvements

Here are the improved versions of the three files that needed the most optimization:

**Files that didn't need major changes:**
- `SkyrimNetApi.psc` - Already well-structured API interface
- `skynet_ExampleScript.psc` - Simple example, already optimal
- `SkyrimNet_agDebugLever01.psc` - Simple debug script, already optimal  
- `skynet_MainController.psc` - Well-organized controller, just minor null checks could be added
- `skynet_PlayerAlias.psc` - Simple event handler, already optimal

## Key Improvements Made:

### **RealNamesChange.psc:**
- **Eliminated massive code duplication** between `QuestNameFalse()` and `QuestNameTrue()`
- **Added faction/setting lookup arrays** for better performance
- **Created reusable helper functions** for name building and faction processing
- **Improved maintainability** - changes only need to be made in one place now

### **SkyrimNetInternal.psc:**
- **Added form caching** to avoid repeated `Game.GetFormFromFile()` calls
- **Consolidated companion functions** with shared validation logic
- **Added comprehensive null checking** throughout
- **Created utility functions** like `GetMainController()` and `SafeEvaluatePackage()`
- **Improved error handling** with graceful fallbacks

### **skynet_Library.psc:**
- **Replaced string-based lookups** with array-based lookups for packages and animations
- **Added initialization system** for lookup arrays
- **Improved animation handling** with dedicated lookup function
- **Enhanced error checking** and null safety
- **Maintained special case handling** (like random applaud selection) while optimizing the common cases

These changes should provide significant performance improvements, especially in scenarios with many NPCs or frequent action calls, while making the code much more maintainable and robust.
